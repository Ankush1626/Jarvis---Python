Introducing Jarvis: A Python-Based Virtual Assistant

Jarvis is a virtual assistant similar to Alexa and Google Home, designed to perform a variety of tasks including web browsing, music playback, and providing news updates. Developed using Python, Jarvis utilizes libraries such as speech_recognition, webbrowser, requests, gtts, and pygame to interact with users and execute commands.

Key Features:

Voice Interaction: Jarvis listens for the wake word "Jarvis" and responds to user commands using speech recognition.
Web Browsing: It can open popular websites like Google, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube.
Music Playback: Jarvis can play songs by opening the corresponding links from a predefined music library.
News Updates: It fetches and reads out the latest news headlines using the News API.

Note:

Replace "YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY" with your actual News API key.
The musicLibrary module should contain a dictionary of song names and their corresponding links.
This implementation provides a solid foundation for a personal virtual assistant, allowing for further customization and expansion based on your needs.
